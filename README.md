# LightingTools : Sunlight

Sunlight entity for unity and HD Render Pipeline.

Settings on the sunlight are the default settings.

Some of the properties can be overriden by Volume (local or global, they interpolate).

Comes with a timeline track. The timeline clips don't have the correct editor, they can only override settings overriden in a volume.
